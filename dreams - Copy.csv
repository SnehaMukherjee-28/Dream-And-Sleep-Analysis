1,"South of Canal St. in Chinatown we were using the Chinese factory after hours to frame pictures and glue them. Joe Fong cut out beautiful, eery, disturbed pictures of blue houses and glued them against black and white skies. He left glue bubbles everywhere. I went down to the corner to wait for my sister. I waited and waited. A guy came by and said, ""What are you doing?"" And I said, ""I'm not sure. If I wait here my sister will walk by."" He said, ""Then I'll wait for you."" I climbed up the ladder to look and see a few of the cards we'd made but really they were junk. William accidentally threw a roll of paper towels out the window onto a busy Chinatown street. Then Carlos threw a stapler out the window. Then a stranger threw a wrench. We agreed it was time to pour wet cement. One inch thick and boards on sides. The Chinese children were running a scam. I could see the sunlight in little girls' hair. Golden sunshine sparkles. I looked over my shoulder for Dora. It was an old show from a TV that was playing. I walked up a steep staircase and was trying to find where we parked the car in Chinatown. I remembered kicking the door 3 times. On top of the building was s steep roof covered with tiny Chinese lanterns. I started stomping lanterns and a girl said, ""What's wrong?"" And I said, ""My sister used to love these."" She said, ""Have you ever had a telepathic experience?"" And I said, ""Yes."" An artist in prison was standing up on a desk. His cell was 8-sided with windows and painted yellow. He was sitting tracing his feet and trying to paint a comma, huge, in one window because, he said, ""What's behind it goes on and on, like what's behind corners. Endless words. Endless space. He was happy drawing.",1.1.2016
2,"I was putting together a plastic bag full of buttons and sewing paraphernalia. It was time to break out of a Hong Kong prison and I was on the fourth tier cell block. I had to wait till the window washers were busy and distract them by throwing ping pong balls so fire hoses filled with cyanide could be squirted on passers-by. I threw a rock through a plate glass window. A thunderstorm had blown up from the south and a guy said I had to be real careful. (The job paid) $4000 to work Sunday through Wednesday with one day off. ""Now count the money,"" she told me, and handed me a stack of counterfeit bills. One five. Two tens, twenty-eight twenties and a $14 bill with (a picture of) millions of New Yorkers. She said, ""Leave or I'll shoot."" I had to squirt the fire hose uphill to wash the bubbles out of the grass. Then the boss lady said, ""I had 3 men working for 4 days and had to shoot them with cyanide sulfide. CLEAN UP THESE BUBBLES AND CYANIDE. Count the $4000. Two of them have the day off.""",2.1.2016
3,"It was time for Holy Communion in the church. Paula and the priest, left to get things ready but I saw cellophane packs of saltine crackers on the coffee table. 8 crackers to a pack. A guy was in church for the first time and I said, ""You know what they're gonna do with these crackers?"" And he said, ""What?"" and I smashed one pack with my fist. ""They do it that way at country churches."" And he said, ""Oh, I better sit in the balcony."" I said, ""It's the old Poplar Springs vs. Mount Gallagher thing."" I put another pack of saltine crackers in my knapsack along with a Webster's dictionary and a bruised banana. (I was) working a job proofreading and there was copy spread all over the table. Newsprint catalogs with long lists of job codes. The boss man said something to hurt Dora's feelings and I screamed out, ""Don't you ever do that again! I could hurt your feelings if I wanted to."" He said, ""Go ahead."" I said, ""There's no reason to hurt someone's feelings."" He said, ""Well I'll hurt yours. You're too quiet on the job."" I laughed and said,",3.1.2016
4,"was a cupcake on a stick at a bakery and I asked the guy, ""How'd you do that?"" And he said, ""With a homemade can opener. It cuts around the edges of corks."" There was laundry going. Mine, Carlos's and Marianna's. Carlos said, ""Watch those clothes!"" I said, ""I'm watching,"" but really I had fallen to sleep. The clothes going in circles were hypnotic. I was watching Marianna's clothes because she was very busy. The clothes were dry and I took them out of the dryer. 2 bras. One was black padded with cheap fiberfill. Very Sears and very worn out. The other was clear translucent mesh with black feathers around the top. I meant to try them on but I forgot. Dirty plates and congealed gravy were left on the dining room table. My mother said, ""Rudy's just got back from this job interview. Merri, make some gravy with this water. Jesus could turn this gravy into wine."" I said, ""Red wine on rice is not very good,"" because I knew they did not have white wine in the New Testament. She said, ""Well pretend there's wine in gravy and we'll leave Jesus out of this. There's water ",4.1.2016
5,I was at the creek. An old lady who was invisible was sitting on the bank watching minnows. One of the minnows was her husband but she was the only one who knew that. I was trying to catch the minnows in my hands and cup my hands together to hold them there. The little fishy's iridescent scales sparkled in the sun. Dora was on the other side of the creek but no one could see her there in the sunshine. I caught 3 minnows and I could feel them flopping around. The invisible lady on the opposite creek bank was worried. I knew her husband had stopped flopping around and that meant he was dead. There was a tiny little boy in a birdcage. He was no more than 1/2 inch tall. He was swinging on the little bird swing like Tweety. I was making him a present out of a piece of red tape about 3 inches long and it needed a bow so I tore a piece of yellow paper that had sticky stuff on the back. I tore it vertically so it would look like a ribbon on the present. I was very excited to be giving him a present as he did not have any. I stuffed the present through the b,5.1.2016
6,"this. I said, ""Alan, this is an awful lot of typositor. We could set it on the machine, but you'd have to do a lot of kerning."" He said, ""It's going to be a busy night."" I was trying to find my pants because I was suppose to teach bible school. Clothes were all over the floor and there were a bunch of loose dollars. The dollar bills had flowers all over them and they were (bright, almost hot florescent) blue, pink, purple and white. They were BEAUTIFUL! I was worried I wasn't sure what we were going to do in the class, but Greg said, ""It'll be fine."" I said, ""I thought we'd make half clocks."" Only the numbers 12 through 6 would be used. I wanted to let the 6-year olds cut out their own numbers. Dora came back in and said, ""You found your pants. I knew you would."" She was very calm. A lady came in to Bible School. It was Ackerman's mother. She had a beige shawl around her shoulders and a beige sweater. I wanted to go give her a hug because she looked extremely nervous.",6.1.2016
7,"Trying to get out of the tree house with Evelyn. She first made a series of phone calls. We were on a weathered unpainted tree house platform hooked up by pulleys on chains and had to haul ourselves to the top of the circus tent. Barbed wire was everywhere and it would be a tight squeeze to get out alive but the union workers appeared to help us, only they didn't do much except tell us what we were required to have, how many people it'd take to get it, and how long. ""What you need is some air,"" the guy told me. What he meant was that air was softer than barbed wire to step on. The union workers cut the label off a hug 6 ft. tall bottle of Clorox with an electric saw and drilled it onto the shovel of the bulldozer. They radioed for a bulldozer to get busy. Harvey was sitting in the library between rows of shelves learning to work the computer. A little boy next to him was playing a video game, eating french fries off the monitor. He had poured ketchup all over the top of the computer monitor and dipped each french fry into the puddle of ketchup. And a ",7.1.2016
8,"There was a Moses hologram card with drippy blood letters like horror movies; about Moses and Jesus producers. On the back half was an invitation to church. In between the lockers loud music was playing sort of like punk stray cats, and punk rock kids were dancing in the hallways. They were so happy to be dancing they started throwing their clothes all over the floor. The music was so good and I was dancing. But eventually we had to leave the hallway and go home. Between 5-6 p.m. there was an advertising meeting. They said at 5-6 p.m. they were either closed for the day or out to lunch or very busy with marketing and will get behind and then you won't get your paycheck. I knew I didn't work there anyway so it didn't matter. While she was still talking I just walked away and she didn't even notice she was talking so much. I went back to the classroom. In the time it took me to talk to that talker lady he had gotten a 4-year college degree in chemistry. We talked about the vertical strength necessary to balance out horizontal weight. The original 3 bank robbers ",12.4.2022
9,"and the U.S. government. I was lying on the floor next to a guy in the classroom. It was naptime. The guy was suppose to be my boyfriend because he sat behind me in school. He did NOT know the answers to the test questions on the black board, so he tried to look on my paper. The teacher down the hall was late getting there and when she did, the sign said, ""5B500."" We could hear the--all the students together in the classroom saying together, ""Hello Miss Johnson."" And she would say, ""Hello class."" ""Hello Miss Johnson."" ""Hello class,"" over and over. I did not have a place to sleep, so I had to sleep in the car, but I forgot to put on the emergency brake and it rolled backwards down the hill. I was in Charleston. At the College there were displays for Wonder Bread. Some bags were full and some had only 5 slices. I went to get some coffee at the snack bar and they told me they didn't sell coffee till after 10 a.m. I was asking people, ""Do you know my sister?"" I told them my sister had hired a doctor for the health services, and they said (that) they'd hired 13 new doctors since then. I kept searching for someone who had known Dora. Girls in ugly, HUGE, way too big shoes were sashaying down the sidewalk. One shoe with feathers was as big as a 10-speed bicycle and she had to move in angles to fit down the hall. That lady who crawled under the table on all fours was licking the floor with her tongue.",14.2.2022
10,"I was not sure what gender I belonged to. Dora was not a fancy man. She liked things simple. Watching the water turn to ice. Watching the small icebergs sink just a few inches to watch the water displacement though the journey was only to the other side with flips to, not sure, maybe tolenburg? There was no need to hurry.",16.2.2022
11,"in half like he was cutting back and swiped up a handful--quick-like, like in playing jacks. He put them in his pocket and left. This made me fed up with New York and I went to Florida back to my old art school to paint undisturbed for a while. Before I left I saw them throwing out some beautiful, very stylish, black standing lamps and I wanted to take one. There were 5. But it was 6 feet tall and a lot to carry to Florida without a car. When I got there it was night and I was appalled at the long distances between ATMs, when you didn't have a car. Kids at the steps near the ocean, hanging out talking to me. I resolved not to suck up to their brown nosing, even though I was lonely not knowing anyone. I went to a bar where they also fixed bicycles and in came girls who'd found 5 bicycles. Those deco lamps had folded out into bicycles. I was mad at myself for not getting one when I saw them tossed out. They were all identical--flat black Schwinns, sleek girls' model bikes. The girls were sewing square multi-colored scarves onto army backpacks. I left the bar and it was raining and I climbed in somebody's window, but walking across the floor the booby trap got me. It had rubber hoses and suction cups that would grab me and was like a rubber blanket of leeches. I finally got out and the art student recognized me. ""Aren't you the one who broke into my house?"" I said, ""I'll return your tape."" At least his place smelled like turpentine. I went into an all-night Chinese restaurant (looking for cigarettes) and to get a cup of coffee to go. She rang it up--$1.50. I said, ""$1.50 for a plain old cup of coffee? You can just throw it away. I won't pay $1.50 for a fifty-cent cup of coffee."" I felt like I had done the right thing.",17.2.2022

13,"and maybe Carlos said something. The shelves were empty. Empty going on forever. Christmas maybe, not sure Something about 25,000 feet. Left. Right.",19.2.2022
14,"jail, people were ??? and when I got up to get my sentence (in line) he told me instead of TIME. I asked could I go get cigarettes but the jail keeper said NO. ??? no. When it came time to see the judge we were standing in a line. Tribeca was moving over a block and the drag queens were taking over the block. Very tall zipping up their dresses. The cops caught me and I was in jail and when I came up in front of the judge they said my sentence was to rat. The guy before me, they told him, ""We're doing a 'buy and bust' over at 7th St. and you'll probably be shot dead."" It was his first offense. He was a nice kid. Then it was my turn and the lady judge said, ""Your spot is on 26 St. gaming strip."" I said, ""the West Side is not my territory. I don't know where that is."" The judge said, ""YOU BETTER!"" And I skated by and sure enough it was the gaming dock and ramps and roller blading and basketball and lots of drag queen hookers and regular hookers ???",19.2.2022
